Unknown source file : It is also often of questionable legality.
Unknown source file : If you really intend to build a core library -- which is only

Unknown source file : Ill-advised or mistaken usage of a core class (java.* or javax.*)
Unknown source file : when not building a core library.
Unknown source file : This is often due to inadvertently including a core library file
Unknown source file : in your application's project, when using an IDE (such as
Unknown source file : Eclipse). If you are sure you're not intentionally defining a
Unknown source file : core class, then this is the most likely explanation of what's
Unknown source file : going on.
Unknown source file : However, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core
Unknown source file : namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example,
Unknown source file : from a non-Android virtual machine project. This will most
Unknown source file : assuredly not work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the
Unknown source file : compatibility of your app with future versions of the platform.
Unknown source file : It is also often of questionable legality.
Unknown source file : If you really intend to build a core library -- which is only
Unknown source file : appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine
Unknown source file : distribution, as opposed to compiling an application -- then use
Unknown source file : the "--core-library" option to suppress this error message.
Unknown source file : If you go ahead and use "--core-library" but are in fact
Unknown source file : building an application, then be forewarned that your application
Unknown source file : will still fail to build or run, at some point. Please be
Unknown source file : prepared for angry customers who find, for example, that your
Unknown source file : application ceases to function once they upgrade their operating
Unknown source file : system. You will be to blame for this problem.
Unknown source file : If you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a
Unknown source file : core package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to
Unknown source file : repackage that code. That is, move the classes in question into
Unknown source file : your own package namespace. This means that they will never be in
Unknown source file : conflict with core system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help
Unknown source file : you in this endeavor. If you find that you cannot do this, then
Unknown source file : that is an indication that the path you are on will ultimately
Unknown source file : lead to pain, suffering, grief, and lamentation.

Unknown source file : Ill-advised or mistaken usage of a core class (java.* or javax.*)
Unknown source file : when not building a core library.
Unknown source file : This is often due to inadvertently including a core library file
Unknown source file : in your application's project, when using an IDE (such as
Unknown source file : Eclipse). If you are sure you're not intentionally defining a
Unknown source file : core class, then this is the most likely explanation of what's
Unknown source file : going on.
Unknown source file : However, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core
Unknown source file : namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example,
Unknown source file : from a non-Android virtual machine project. This will most
Unknown source file : assuredly not work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the
Unknown source file : compatibility of your app with future versions of the platform.
Unknown source file : It is also often of questionable legality.
Unknown source file : If you really intend to build a core library -- which is only
Unknown source file : appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine
Unknown source file : distribution, as opposed to compiling an application -- then use
Unknown source file : the "--core-library" option to suppress this error message.
Unknown source file : If you go ahead and use "--core-library" but are in fact
Unknown source file : building an application, then be forewarned that your application
Unknown source file : will still fail to build or run, at some point. Please be
Unknown source file : prepared for angry customers who find, for example, that your
Unknown source file : application ceases to function once they upgrade their operating
Unknown source file : system. You will be to blame for this problem.
Unknown source file : If you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a
Unknown source file : core package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to
Unknown source file : repackage that code. That is, move the classes in question into
Unknown source file : your own package namespace. This means that they will never be in
Unknown source file : conflict with core system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help
Unknown source file : you in this endeavor. If you find that you cannot do this, then
Unknown source file : that is an indication that the path you are on will ultimately
Unknown source file : lead to pain, suffering, grief, and lamentation.

Unknown source file : Ill-advised or mistaken usage of a core class (java.* or javax.*)
Unknown source file : when not building a core library.
Unknown source file : This is often due to inadvertently including a core library file
Unknown source file : in your application's project, when using an IDE (such as
Unknown source file : Eclipse). If you are sure you're not intentionally defining a
Unknown source file : core class, then this is the most likely explanation of what's
Unknown source file : going on.
Unknown source file : However, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core
Unknown source file : namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example,
Unknown source file : from a non-Android virtual machine project. This will most
Unknown source file : assuredly not work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the
Unknown source file : compatibility of your app with future versions of the platform.
Unknown source file : It is also often of questionable legality.
Unknown source file : If you really intend to build a core library -- which is only
Unknown source file : appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine
Unknown source file : distribution, as opposed to compiling an application -- then use
Unknown source file : the "--core-library" option to suppress this error message.
Unknown source file : If you go ahead and use "--core-library" but are in fact
Unknown source file : building an application, then be forewarned that your application
Unknown source file : will still fail to build or run, at some point. Please be
Unknown source file : prepared for angry customers who find, for example, that your
Unknown source file : application ceases to function once they upgrade their operating
Unknown source file : system. You will be to blame for this problem.
Unknown source file : If you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a
Unknown source file : core package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to
Unknown source file : repackage that code. That is, move the classes in question into
Unknown source file : your own package namespace. This means that they will never be in
Unknown source file : conflict with core system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help
Unknown source file : you in this endeavor. If you find that you cannot do this, then
Unknown source file : that is an indication that the path you are on will ultimately

Unknown source file : Ill-advised or mistaken usage of a core class (java.* or javax.*)
Unknown source file : when not building a core library.
Unknown source file : This is often due to inadvertently including a core library file
Unknown source file : in your application's project, when using an IDE (such as
Unknown source file : Eclipse). If you are sure you're not intentionally defining a
Unknown source file : core class, then this is the most likely explanation of what's
Unknown source file : going on.
Unknown source file : However, you might actually be trying to define a class in a core
Unknown source file : namespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example,
Unknown source file : from a non-Android virtual machine project. This will most
Unknown source file : assuredly not work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes the
Unknown source file : compatibility of your app with future versions of the platform.
Unknown source file : It is also often of questionable legality.
Unknown source file : If you really intend to build a core library -- which is only
Unknown source file : appropriate as part of creating a full virtual machine
Unknown source file : distribution, as opposed to compiling an application -- then use
Unknown source file : the "--core-library" option to suppress this error message.
Unknown source file : If you go ahead and use "--core-library" but are in fact
Unknown source file : building an application, then be forewarned that your application
Unknown source file : will still fail to build or run, at some point. Please be
Unknown source file : prepared for angry customers who find, for example, that your
Unknown source file : application ceases to function once they upgrade their operating
Unknown source file : system. You will be to blame for this problem.
Unknown source file : If you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in a
Unknown source file : core package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is to
Unknown source file : repackage that code. That is, move the classes in question into
Unknown source file : your own package namespace. This means that they will never be in
Unknown source file : conflict with core system classes. JarJar is a tool that may help
Unknown source file : you in this endeavor. If you find that you cannot do this, then
